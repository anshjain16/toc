# TOC Lab

TOC Lab is a comprehensive web application designed to help you explore and experiment with automata theory. The toolkit provides interactive tools for simulating finite automata, creating custom automata, converting between FSMs and regular expressions, minimizing DFAs, and converting NFAs to DFAs.

## Features

- **Finite Automata Simulator**  
  Simulate DFAs and NFAs interactively with step-by-step visualization of state transitions and input processing.

- **Custom Automata Creator**  
  Build your own automata manually or generate random automata. Define states, transitions, and other properties using an intuitive interface.

- **FSM to Regular Expression Converter**  
  Transform finite state machines into regular expressions and vice versa, simplifying complex automata into pattern representations.

- **DFA Minimizer**  
  Optimize your DFAs by minimizing the number of states, making your automata more efficient and easier to understand.

- **NFA to DFA Converter**  
  Convert nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) to equivalent deterministic finite automata (DFAs) using robust conversion algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – The core web technologies powering the project.
- **Bootstrap 5** – For a modern, responsive design.
- **jQuery** – For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Viz.js** – To generate and display visual representations of automata graphs.
